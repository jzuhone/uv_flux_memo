\section{Calculations}

It should be noted at the outset that the goal is to calculate a ``worst-case'' UV fluence,
which will necessitate a number of simplifying assumptions that will be detailed throughout this
memo.

\subsection{Flux from Bright Earth}

Our first source of UV flux that we consider is that which is from the Sun, backscattered
from the Earth's atmosphere.

Though \chandra does not directly observe the bright Earth, the Earth can be scanned during
maneuvers. Therefore, in order to determine the total UV fluence reflected from the bright
arth which impinged upon the OBFs, it is necessary to determine the total time accumulated over
the lifetime of the mission when the following two conditions are simultaneously satisfied:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Earth is in the \chandra field of view
\item ACIS is in the focal plane
\end{enumerate}

We assume that condition 1 is satisfied when the angular radius of the Earth is less than the
angular distance between the Earth and the aimpoint. This was determined by querying
the \code{Ska} engineering archive for the MSIDs \code{Dist\_SatEarth} and \code{Point\_EarthCentAng},
corresponding to the distance between the Earth's center and \chandra ($D_E$) and the angle $\phi_E$ between
the Earth and the aimpoint, respectively. The angular radius of the Earth $\theta_E$ is determined
via $\theta_E = \tan^{-1} (R_\oplus/D_E)$. We assume that condition 2 is satisfied when the TSC
position is $\geq$ -25,000. This can be determined using the MSID \code{3TSCPOS} from the \code{Ska}
archive.

The time resolution of the first two MSIDs in the archive is $\Delta{t} = 5$~min, whereas the resolution
of \code{3TSCPOS} is 32.8~seconds, so the time resolution of the calculation is limited to 5-minute intervals.
This likely results in a modest overestimate of the total length of time that the OBFs have been exposed to
the bright Earth, since the Earth will be entering and exiting the field of view during some of these intervals.
This is consistent with our ``worst-case'' approach to this problem. The total time $\Delta{T}$ within which our two
conditions are satisfied is thus:

\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta{T} &=& \displaystyle\sum_i~\Delta{t_i},~{\rm where}~(\phi_{E,i} \leq \theta_{E,i})~{\rm and}~(\code{3TSCPOS}_i > -25000) \\
\nonumber &=& 2.73~{\rm hr}
\end{eqnarray}

Figure \ref{fig:time_accum} shows the accumulation of this time over the duration of the mission.

We assume that the UV photons are reflected from the HRMA onto the focal plane with 100\% efficiency,
so the effective area is $A_{\rm eff} = 1145$~cm$^2$. The ``plate scale'' $\Delta{S}$ of the ACIS focal plane is
0.0205"/$\mu$m. The fluence of photons which can break H-C and C=C bonds are then, respectively:

\begin{eqnarray}
H_{\rm H-C} &=& I_{\rm H-C}A_{\rm eff}(\Delta{S})^2\Delta{T} = 4.06 \times 10^{12}~{\rm photons~cm^{-2}} \\
H_{\rm C=C} &=& I_{\rm C=C}A_{\rm eff}(\Delta{S})^2\Delta{T} = 3.38 \times 10^{15}~{\rm photons~cm^{-2}}
\end{eqnarray}
